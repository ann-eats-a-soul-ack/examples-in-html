        we sank into a portal <br />
        without noticing. <br />
       
        I slept and woke several times. <br />
        One time I woke to a warped desert, <br />
        it was dark, no buildings or scenery at all, <br />
        like a vacation to the void, <br />
        with the exception of a dirt track. <br />
       
        The only sign there was a track <br />
        was the lights of a truck a few kilometres ahead of us. <br />
        In those lights, I could see the road was serpentine. <br />

        My sister says she doesn’t remember any of that <br />
        but she knows it was the same drive <br />
        when we stopped at a restoran <br />
        in the middle of the forest <br />
        because she needed to piss.<br />
        They only had a čučavac toilet <br />
        so Mama had to teach her how to use it. <br />
        We bought a Fanta from the restoran <br />
        and Mama got sick of holding it after an hour, <br />
        so she threw the liquid <br />
        out the window, <br />
        squished the can <br />
        and tossed it in our plastic bag for trash. <br />
