I didn’t have the number saved 
but I already knew who it was from, 
from the laughing in the world 
I went to the voices that taunt you, 
the details of their breaths 
He wanted to show me a reason to leave 
I want someone in my bed
He wanted to try on his heart like gum 

I tell a colleague I keep converting oxygen with, 
our heads on the desk, 
how many times u touch the stones growing around u
is how many times someone cares as u undress
I tell her that I want space
What I’m saying is 
I’ve only ever vowed to love and be loved 
But I want to be left alone 
like the head of a crocodile 
I want to tell you 
lie inside my top that I’m cutting with scissors 

It’s true u are in every time I go to sleep alone 
I’m not saying I want to love and be loved 
While hurling a days worth of food into a toilet bowl 
I drown in every puddle 

there is a smart move he wanted to show me 
a bar in a never ending dance with the world 

the windows don’t close enough to keep the memories out 

a piano lives forever 
like by preexisting, our desire dances 
before shooting the possibility 
trust our breath 
you don't need a doctor to erase ppl 
I considered following someone's breath 

the world as a shitty irish pub 
the forests make poems that accelerate our hearts
I want to keep trying on my eyelids each day

someone in your imagination holds all your words like a sleeping cat
grandmothers are the evidence
we do not need a doctor to say dance with one breath then the next 
you call the things I want to tell you 
300 years worth of tenderness in the atmosphere
how can we detach from the dead 
from the laughing in the background

hunting for words before the song runs out 
learn how to clean decorative coral 

I am 135 crabs on the windowsill birds do for love 
The windows say you can be an ambassador of memory too 

there is another question into ur flesh 

lots of mushrooms but only 30 are for human consumption 

every time u touch the stones growing around u they will stop growing forever 
I have to remember this 
ppl keep telling me 
do not plan love feel it 

watch every speck of dust falling
every gesture of their lives forever 

The emergency is that I want u to remember me
But I leave tomorrow 

I’m leaking collectivity 
We’ve levied our care 
Birds keep advertising romance 

I didn’t have the number saved 
but I already knew who it was from, 
from the laughing in the world 
I went to the voices that taunt you, 
the details of their breaths 
He wanted to show me a reason to leave 
I want someone in my bed
In the folds of a shitty irish bar 
He wanted to try on his heart like gum 
and then stuck it on the underside 
of a place I don’t need to see myself reflected 

I tell a colleague I keep calling friend 
that I want space
What I’m saying is 
I’ve only ever vowed to love and be loved 
The pathetic here 
is what is inside me 
I want to be left alone 
like the head of a crocodile 
I want to tell you 
lie inside my top that I’m cutting with scissors 

It’s true u are in every time I go to sleep alone 
I’m not saying I want to love and be loved 
While hurling a days worth of food into a toilet bowl 
I drown in every puddle 

For me xcretions from ur chin 
the lights were off so 

there is a smart move he wanted to show me 
a bar in a never ending dance with the world 

every speck of dust falling 
every gesture of the cabinets peels, 
the windows don’t close enough to keep the memories out 

most exposed leaf on a tree 
roots intertwined and fed 

Each day of work is never ending 
a piano lives forever 
like by preexisting our desire dances 
before shooting the possibility 
trust our breath 
you don't need a doctor to erase ppl 
if the past or sunlight of my sixteenth birthday 
I considered following someone's breath 

the world as a shitty irish pub 
the forests make poems that accelerated our hearts
I want to keep trying on my eyelids each day 

friendship is a performance I imagine every day 
it’s my cliff edge to the open ocean 
my middle of nowhere that feels significant when shared

I lost sleep with friends & it felt like heaven 
it felt like every relationship I’d doubted didn’t matter anymore 

you can’t just ask ppl
to direct you towards an archive of their thoughts & actions  

making friends is poetry
we wouldn’t need words 
if we didn’t want ppl to share them with

sometimes my attempts at helping ppl 
turn to gutting myself in front of them
& wanting my intestines to feel held too

is friendship
just a way to find the monster in me?
that wants to not just survive 
but be seen surviving 

I spend so much time imagining myself in relationships 
that don’t exist 
they don’t exist because I haven’t fed them 

& march into ppls lives like 
something essential but unexpected 

I want an ending where we float instead 

cutting ceremony out of my birthdays 
what gives for love you can photograph mine 
do not solve life experience it  

this silly little outfit, the year’s dwindling days 
someone in your imagination cares as you undress 
in the details of their breaths 
I tell a colleague I keep converting oxygen with, 
our heads on the desk 
a sign of boredom, fatigue 
how many times u touch the stones growing around u

critics are the evidence 
we do not need a doctor to say dance with one breath then the next 
don’t be weird about this you call the things I want to tell you 
tenderness in the atmosphere
for over 300 years 
how can we detach from the dead 
from the laughing in the background

hunting for words before the song runs out 
learn how to clean decorative coral 

I have the number saved but I already knew ants ate trees 
she caught a mouse with her bare hands once
slovenian motorway u have to remember this when I come back  
I am 135 crabs on the windowsill birds do for love 
The windows say you can be an ambassador of memory too 

there is another question into ur flesh 
to keep ur lights on day and night 
To tell me to forget the past or to say dance dance before they arrive 

The verneer of a drip stone u need 100 years to grow 

lots of mushrooms but only 30 are for human consumption 

every time u touch the stones growing around u they will stop growing forever 

I have to remember this when the moon reaches back

ppl keep telling me 
do not plan love feel it 

so I became their bedroom window
to watch 
every speck of dust falling
every gesture of their lives forever 

He wanted to try on his heart like gum 

The emergency is that I want u to remember me
But I leave tomorrow 
The emergency is that I'm hesitating
But the night is over 
The emergency is 
this city keeps leaking on me

people can an invent a twisted version of you 

for only one centimeter of a drip stone u need 100 years to grow

how can I hold you digitally ?

how do you show care in a digital space ?


I will / tax / your / soul / I prefer / themselves 


on my last night in London 
a fox decided I was less dangerous than a car 
I think she wanted to feel held too
we'd both been looking for free food 
what counts as currency in the middle of the night ?
